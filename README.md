# webkit-luajit

An application framework built around:

* webkit
* luajit
* threejs
* gltf loaders 
* aspect (twig)
* and many more awesome luajit libs



With this toolkit there are a number of samples in the project folder. 



These can be run by changing the config settings in the project/main.lua script - specifically, lines 55-56. 



I will add some documentation for this later. This is an \_old\_ project I did over 5 yrs ago (and more) to build something like electron with NodeJS from Chrome/Webkit + luajit. So it is mostly an experiment. 



Warning: There are lots of limitations with Webkit as well as how it runs with luajit. It probably needs a fair amount of love to get it to a really production ready release setup. But, there are tools and such that help with that. srlua can be used to package the whole application into a single exe + data (Ive made builds of this available in thirdparty folder). 



I have published this because I wanted somewhere to keep it, where I wouldn't lose it. I will come back to this one day because it is a powerful framework. For now, it is all MIT (I think) with the exception of the artwork that is from Sketchfab. 



## Artwork

Please respect the authors licensing in the 3D art folders. There should be a license file in each of the folders. I DO NOT own this artwork, and it is publically available for free on sketchfab. Im including the links below, since the artists have made some great works here:



https://sketchfab.com/S1Priv

* A10, B1, M3A3, F14, USS Hurrican



https://sketchfab.com/Nicholas01

* Low poly houses



https://sketchfab.com/steam813

* low poly cars 2



Thanks to those artists. I added these because my original own art is purchased and has restrictive licenses on them. 



## Summary

If you want to use this framework or parts of it, feel free to use as you want. If you need help, then raise an issue and I will attempt to help as best I can.
